## â…  C++ Fundamentals

### 1 C & C++ Introduction

1. C/C++ is a compiled language.

2. C/C++ compilers map C/C++ programs into architecture-specific machine code (string of
 0s and 1s).
    * Unlike Java, which converts to architecture-independent bytecode (run by JVM => 
    Java Virtual Machine).
    * Unlike Python, which directly interprets the code.
    * Main difference is when your program is mapped to low-level machine instructions, 
    CPU will directly interprets and runs.

<p style="color: BlueViolet">Compilation Advantages</p>

* Excellent run-time performance:

  Generally much faster than Python or Java for comparable code because it optimizes for 
  the given architecture.

* Fair compilation time:

  Enhancements in compilation procedure (Makefiles) allow us to recompile only the 
  modified files.

<p style="color: BlueViolet">Compilation Disadvantages</p>

* Compiled files, including the executable, are arcitecture-specific (CPU type and OS).

  Executable must be rebuilt on each new system, i.e., "porting your code" to a new 
  architecture.

* Instead of "Edit -> Run [repeat]" cycle, "Edit -> Compile -> Run [repeat]" iteration 
  cycle can be slow.

Normal C/C++ Compile & Run:

```bash
$ g++ -o hello hello.cpp
```
