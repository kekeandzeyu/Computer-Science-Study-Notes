### 1.1 Agent Design  

There are mainly two types of agents: **reflex agents** and **planning agents**.

1. **Reflex Agents:**
    * Choose action based on current percept, and may have memory or a model of the 
    world's current state.
    * Do not consider the future consequences of their actions, just consider how the 
    world <span style="color:OrangeRed">IS</span>.
2. **Planning Agents:**
    * Decisions based on (hypothesized) consequences of actions.
    * Must have a model of how the world evolves in response to actions, and formulate a 
    goal (test), consider how the world <span style="color:OrangeRed">WOULD BE</span>
