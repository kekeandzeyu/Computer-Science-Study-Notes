## Ⅰ C++ Fundamentals

## 1 C & C++ Introduction

1. C/C++ is a compiled language.

2. C/C++ compilers map C/C++ programs into architecture-specific machine code (string of
 0s and 1s).
    * Unlike Java, which converts to architecture-independent bytecode (run by JVM => 
    Java Virtual Machine).
    * Unlike Python, which directly interprets the code.
    * Main difference is when your program is mapped to low-level machine instructions, 
    CPU will directly interprets and runs.

<p style="color: BlueViolet">Compilation Advantages</p>

* Excellent run-time performance:

  Generally much faster than Python or Java for comparable code because it optimizes for 
  the given architecture.

* Fair compilation time:

  Enhancements in compilation procedure (Makefiles) allow us to recompile only the 
  modified files.

<p style="color: BlueViolet">Compilation Disadvantages</p>

* Compiled files, including the executable, are arcitecture-specific (CPU type and OS).

  Executable must be rebuilt on each new system, i.e., "porting your code" to a new 
  architecture.

* Instead of "Edit -> Run [repeat]" cycle, "Edit -> Compile -> Run [repeat]" iteration 
  cycle can be slow.

Normal C/C++ Compile & Run:

```bash
$ g++ -o hello hello.cpp
```

## 2 Types & Structs

### 2.1 Primitive Types

| Fundamental Types | Example                     | Memory   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
| int               | `int val = 5;`              | 4 bytes  |
| char              | `char ch = 'F';`            | 1 byte   |
| float             | `float decimalVal1 = 5.0;`  | 4 bytes  |
| double            | `double decimalVal2 = 5.0;` | 8 bytes  |
| bool              | `bool bVal = true;`         | 1 byte   |
| std::string       | `std::string str = "Hello";`| -        |

### 2.2 Structs

A **struct** is a group of named variables, each with their own type, that allows
programmers to bundle different types together!

```cpp
/* C++ Style */
struct Student {
    string name; // these are called fields
    string state; // separate these by semicolons
    int age;
};

/* C Style */
typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    char state[3];
    int age;
} Student;
 
Student s;
s.name = "Haven";
s.state = "AR";
s.age = 22; // use . to access fields
```

### 2.3 Union

Unions are similar to structs, but all members share the same memory location, and union only provides enough space for the largest element.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

union Shape {
    int radius; // For circle
    struct {
        int width;
        int height;
    } rectangle; // For rectangle
};

int main() {
    Shape shape;
    shape.radius = 5;
    std::cout << "Radius: " << shape.radius << std::endl; // Radius: 5

    shape.rectangle.width = 10;
    shape.rectangle.height = 20;
    std::cout << "Width: " << shape.rectangle.width << ", Height: " << shape.rectangle.height << std::endl; // Width: 10, Height: 20

    std::cout << "Radius: " << shape.radius << std::endl; // No meaning, the radius has been overwritten!

    return 0;
}
```

## 3 Initialization & References

### 3.1 Initialization

There are three types of initialization in C++:

1. Direct Initialization

```cpp
int numOne = 12.0; // numOne is 12, doesn't type check with direct initialzation
```

2. Uniform Initialization (C++ 11)

```cpp
int numTwo {12.0};
// Narrowing conversion of '1.2e+1' from 'double' to 'int'
// Type checks with uniform initialization
```

3. Structure Binding (C++ 17, can access multiple values returned by a function)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <tuple>
#include <string>

std::tuple<std::string, std::string, std::string> getclassInfo() {
    std::string className = "CS106L";
    std::string buildingName = "Turing Auditorium";
    std::string language = "C++";
    return {className, buildingName, language};
}

int main() {
    auto [className, buildingName, language] = getclassInfo();

    std::cout << "Come to " << buildingName << " and join us for " <<
    className << " to learn " << language << "!" << std::endl;
    // Output: Come to Turing Auditorium and join us for CS106L to learn C++!

    return 0;
}
```

<p style="color:BlueViolet">Advantages for Uniform Initialization</p>

* It's safe! It doesn't allow for narrowing conversions — which can lead to unexpected 
  behaviour (or critical system failures).
* It's ubiquitous! it works for all types like vectors, maps, and custom classes, among
  other things.

### 3.2 References

```cpp
int x = 5;
int& ref = x; // ref is a reference to x
ref = 10; // x is now 10
```

### 3.3 Pointers

```cpp
int x = 5;
int* ref = &x; // ref is a pointer to x
*ref = 10; // x is now 10
```

A classic reference-copy bug:

```cpp
// We are modifying the std::pair's inside of nums
void shift(std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> &nums) { // nums passed by reference
    for (auto [num1, num2] : nums) { // num1 and num2 are copies
        num1++;
        num2++;
    }
}
```

In this code, `nums` is passed by reference to the shift function, which means any
modifications to `nums` should affect the original vector. However, within the for loop, 
`num1` and `num2` are declared as copies of the elements in nums. As a result, the 
increments `num1++` and `num2++` modify only the local copies, and the original elements 
in nums remain unchanged. Below is the correct way:

```cpp
// Correct Way
void shift(std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> &nums) {
    for (auto& [num1, num2] : nums) {
        num1++;
        num2++;
    }
}
```

## 4 Streams

### 4.1 Strings

<p style="color:BlueViolet">Example in C++</p>

```cpp
std::string str = "Hello, World!";
std::cout << str[1] << std::endl; // e
str[1] = 'a'; // Hallo, World!
```

<p style="color:BlueViolet">Example in C</p>

```c
char str[] = "Hello, World!";
printf("%c\n", str[1]); // e
str[1] = 'a'; // Hallo, World!
```

### 4.2 Stringstreams

<p style="color:BlueViolet">Properties</p>

* Constructors with initial text in the buffer.
* Can optionally provide "modes" such as `ate` (start at end) or `bin` (read as binary).

#### 4.2.1 Output Stringstreams

<p style="color:BlueViolet">Examples</p>

```cpp
std::ostringstream oss("Ito-En Green Tea");
std::cout << oss.str() << std::endl; // Ito-En Green Tea
oss << "16.9 Ounces";
std::cout << oss.str() << std::endl; // 16.9 Ouncesn Tea

std::ostringstream oss("Ito-En Green Tea", std::ostringstream::ate);
oss << "16.9 Ounces";
std::cout << oss.str() << std::endl; // Ito-En Green Tea16.9 Ounces
```
